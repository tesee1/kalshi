Many of us have been in situations we felt little or no control over. We like certainty because it gives us a feeling of control.

Kalshi markets are a way to get a glimpse into the future, which we can use to make better decisions. You can trade on the outcome of future events, including those that affect your wallet like inflation, Joe Biden's approval rating, and even Leo's chances of winning an Oscar.

    content: `
We all have the ability to recognize patterns and make predictions about what's coming next. If enough people share their opinions about something, we're more likely to come up with accurate predictions and make better decisions.

In each market, it's possible to buy and sell contracts from either direction. The higher the price, the more likely that event is to occur. For example, traders predict that the Federal tax to increase, but they don't think the State tax will change. If you agree, you can buy contracts for ”Yes, federal tax becomes law” and another for ”No, State tax fails to become law”.

    content: `
After accumulating a position in a market, there are two ways to make a profit. The first is to hold your contracts until the market closes. When the market is settled, you'll receive $1 for every correct contract you own. The second is to sell your position after a favorable fluctuation in prices. For example, if you bought 100 contracts at 41 cents and their price rises to 83 cents, you can sell before the market closes for a $42 profit.

    title: "What are event contracts?",
    content: `
Event contracts are an asset class that give investors the ability to trade directly on their opinions about a specific yes-or-no question. Event contracts offer direct exposure to or a hedge to a wide range of risks including inflation, fed rates, debt ceiling, recessions, student loans, politics, climate and weather, and more.

You can buy event contracts at any price between 1¢ and 99¢. At close, each contract is worth $1 if you're right, and $0 otherwise. You can sell early if you want to.

Kalshi's 2020 regulatory approval followed by the launch of the exchange in January 2022 opened up the market, as the first regulated exchange to offer event contracts.
